# Fast Football - tabletop card game in the browser

This is a Javascript game that I coded in summer of 2015. This was an exploration into building my own game mechanics and logic, without the help of frameworks, like Phaser.io, which I've used before. This is based on a 20+-year-old tabletop card game, that I stumbled upon. As a result, some of the mechanics aren't ideal for a video game, but ...

I focused on getting the visuals to a finished state. I developed all of the visual assets. 

Future plans: I'd like to refactor the game logic into an OO version, to improve data-handling. Also, need to add mobile actions for the UI draggable elements.
